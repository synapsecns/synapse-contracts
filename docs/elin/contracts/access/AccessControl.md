# AccessControl







*Contract module that allows children to implement role-based access control mechanisms. Roles are referred to by their `bytes32` identifier. These should be exposed in the external API and be unique. The best way to achieve this is by using `public constant` hash digests: ``` bytes32 public constant MY_ROLE = keccak256(&quot;MY_ROLE&quot;); ``` Roles can be used to represent a set of permissions. To restrict access to a function call, use {hasRole}: ``` function foo() public {     require(hasRole(MY_ROLE, msg.sender));     ... } ``` Roles can be granted and revoked dynamically via the {grantRole} and {revokeRole} functions. Each role has an associated admin role, and only accounts that have a role&#39;s admin role can call {grantRole} and {revokeRole}. By default, the admin role for all roles is `DEFAULT_ADMIN_ROLE`, which means that only accounts with this role will be able to grant or revoke other roles. More complex role relationships can be created by using {_setRoleAdmin}. WARNING: The `DEFAULT_ADMIN_ROLE` is also its own admin: it has permission to grant and revoke this role. Extra precautions should be taken to secure accounts that have been granted it.*

## Methods

### DEFAULT_ADMIN_ROLE

```solidity
function DEFAULT_ADMIN_ROLE() external view returns (bytes32)
```






#### Returns

| Name | Type | Description |
|---|---|---|
| _0 | bytes32 | undefined |

### getRoleAdmin

```solidity
function getRoleAdmin(bytes32 role) external view returns (bytes32)
```



*Returns the admin role that controls `role`. See {grantRole} and {revokeRole}. To change a role&#39;s admin, use {_setRoleAdmin}.*

#### Parameters

| Name | Type | Description |
|---|---|---|
| role | bytes32 | undefined |

#### Returns

| Name | Type | Description |
|---|---|---|
| _0 | bytes32 | undefined |

### getRoleMember

```solidity
function getRoleMember(bytes32 role, uint256 index) external view returns (address)
```



*Returns one of the accounts that have `role`. `index` must be a value between 0 and {getRoleMemberCount}, non-inclusive. Role bearers are not sorted in any particular way, and their ordering may change at any point. WARNING: When using {getRoleMember} and {getRoleMemberCount}, make sure you perform all queries on the same block. See the following https://forum.openzeppelin.com/t/iterating-over-elements-on-enumerableset-in-openzeppelin-contracts/2296[forum post] for more information.*

#### Parameters

| Name | Type | Description |
|---|---|---|
| role | bytes32 | undefined |
| index | uint256 | undefined |

#### Returns

| Name | Type | Description |
|---|---|---|
| _0 | address | undefined |

### getRoleMemberCount

```solidity
function getRoleMemberCount(bytes32 role) external view returns (uint256)
```



*Returns the number of accounts that have `role`. Can be used together with {getRoleMember} to enumerate all bearers of a role.*

#### Parameters

| Name | Type | Description |
|---|---|---|
| role | bytes32 | undefined |

#### Returns

| Name | Type | Description |
|---|---|---|
| _0 | uint256 | undefined |

### grantRole

```solidity
function grantRole(bytes32 role, address account) external nonpayable
```



*Grants `role` to `account`. If `account` had not been already granted `role`, emits a {RoleGranted} event. Requirements: - the caller must have ``role``&#39;s admin role.*

#### Parameters

| Name | Type | Description |
|---|---|---|
| role | bytes32 | undefined |
| account | address | undefined |

### hasRole

```solidity
function hasRole(bytes32 role, address account) external view returns (bool)
```



*Returns `true` if `account` has been granted `role`.*

#### Parameters

| Name | Type | Description |
|---|---|---|
| role | bytes32 | undefined |
| account | address | undefined |

#### Returns

| Name | Type | Description |
|---|---|---|
| _0 | bool | undefined |

### renounceRole

```solidity
function renounceRole(bytes32 role, address account) external nonpayable
```



*Revokes `role` from the calling account. Roles are often managed via {grantRole} and {revokeRole}: this function&#39;s purpose is to provide a mechanism for accounts to lose their privileges if they are compromised (such as when a trusted device is misplaced). If the calling account had been granted `role`, emits a {RoleRevoked} event. Requirements: - the caller must be `account`.*

#### Parameters

| Name | Type | Description |
|---|---|---|
| role | bytes32 | undefined |
| account | address | undefined |

### revokeRole

```solidity
function revokeRole(bytes32 role, address account) external nonpayable
```



*Revokes `role` from `account`. If `account` had been granted `role`, emits a {RoleRevoked} event. Requirements: - the caller must have ``role``&#39;s admin role.*

#### Parameters

| Name | Type | Description |
|---|---|---|
| role | bytes32 | undefined |
| account | address | undefined |



## Events

### RoleAdminChanged

```solidity
event RoleAdminChanged(bytes32 indexed role, bytes32 indexed previousAdminRole, bytes32 indexed newAdminRole)
```



*Emitted when `newAdminRole` is set as ``role``&#39;s admin role, replacing `previousAdminRole` `DEFAULT_ADMIN_ROLE` is the starting admin for all roles, despite {RoleAdminChanged} not being emitted signaling this. _Available since v3.1._*

#### Parameters

| Name | Type | Description |
|---|---|---|
| role `indexed` | bytes32 | undefined |
| previousAdminRole `indexed` | bytes32 | undefined |
| newAdminRole `indexed` | bytes32 | undefined |

### RoleGranted

```solidity
event RoleGranted(bytes32 indexed role, address indexed account, address indexed sender)
```



*Emitted when `account` is granted `role`. `sender` is the account that originated the contract call, an admin role bearer except when using {_setupRole}.*

#### Parameters

| Name | Type | Description |
|---|---|---|
| role `indexed` | bytes32 | undefined |
| account `indexed` | address | undefined |
| sender `indexed` | address | undefined |

### RoleRevoked

```solidity
event RoleRevoked(bytes32 indexed role, address indexed account, address indexed sender)
```



*Emitted when `account` is revoked `role`. `sender` is the account that originated the contract call:   - if using `revokeRole`, it is the admin role bearer   - if using `renounceRole`, it is the role bearer (i.e. `account`)*

#### Parameters

| Name | Type | Description |
|---|---|---|
| role `indexed` | bytes32 | undefined |
| account `indexed` | address | undefined |
| sender `indexed` | address | undefined |
