# L1BridgeZap



> L1BridgeZap

This contract is responsible for handling user Zaps into the SynapseBridge contract, through the Synapse Swap contracts. It does so It does so by combining the action of addLiquidity() to the base swap pool, and then calling either deposit() or depositAndSwap() on the bridge. This is done in hopes of automating portions of the bridge user experience to users, while keeping the SynapseBridge contract logic small.

*This contract should be deployed with a base Swap.sol address and a SynapseBridge.sol address, otherwise, it will not function.*

### calculateTokenAmount

```solidity

#### Returns

| Name | Type | Description |
|---|---|---|
| _0 | uint256 | token amount the user will receive |
