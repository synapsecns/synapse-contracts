/**
 * @title AaveSwap - A StableSwap implementation in solidity, integrated with Aave.
 * @notice This contract is responsible for custody of closely pegged assets (eg. group of stablecoins)
 * and automatic market making system. Users become an LP (Liquidity Provider) by depositing their tokens
 * in desired ratios for an exchange of the pool token that represents their share of the pool.
 * Users can burn pool tokens and withdraw their share of token(s).
 *
 * Each time a swap between the pooled tokens happens, a set fee incurs which effectively gets
 * distributed to the LPs.
 *
 * In case of emergencies, admin can pause additional deposits, swaps, or single-asset withdraws - which
 * stops the ratio of the tokens in the pool from changing.
 * Users can always withdraw their tokens via multi-asset withdraws.
 *
 * @dev Most of the logic is stored as a library `SwapUtils` for the sake of reducing contract's
 * deployment size.
